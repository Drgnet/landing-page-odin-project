Landing Page project for flexboxes

This is my second project for The Odin Project. I just went through the
lesson on Flexboxes, and this project is to finish off the section. This
one was a little tougher, but was fun to figure all the pieces out. In
this project, I am to make a website landing page from scratch. And try to
clone using the materials I have learned so far. Next section I start on
JavaScrip, and I am really excited to dive into that!
