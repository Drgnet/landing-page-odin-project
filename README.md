Landing Page project for flexboxes

This is my second project for The Odin Project. I just went through the
lesson on Flexboxes, and this project is to finish off the section. This
one was a little tougher, but was fun to figure all the pieces out. In
this project, I am to make a website landing page from scratch. And try to
clone using the materials I have learned so far. Next section I start on
JavaScrip, and I am really excited to dive into that!
I just finished the first section of the lading page, and I think it went
really well! The flexbox was a little mindbending to wrap my brain around,
but I think I got the hang of it pretty well. At least enough to be able 
to find the answers myself if I google them. I was going to try to work on
my site a bit more today with my new hand-me-down laptop, but I can't get
the USB drive to work so I can get my pictures off of it. I may try to just add more content to the HTML so I can still push on without being at a complete
stalemate.
